This repository demonstrates a subtle but important difference in the behavior of the `removeIf` function when applied to `MutableList` and `MutableSet` in Kotlin.  The example code showcases how `removeIf` modifies the collection in-place, potentially leading to unexpected results if not handled carefully. The solution provides a safer approach using a copy of the original collection.
